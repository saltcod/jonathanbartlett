A new base theme. Very largely based on Toolbox, the barebones, HTML5 theme from Automattic (http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/toolbox).

This theme aims to aleviate some of the startup work involved in using Toolbox. It sets some sensible defaults, removes the comments template, and outlines the major areas—primary, secondary, main, articles, headers, footers, etc.

Pages are structured thusly: 

— body
— header#branding
— nav
— main
— primary  
  — content
  — article
— secondary
— footer#colophon
